<p>There are two main technologies I use to keep the site alive:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com">Bootstrap</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hugo.com">Hugo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Bootstrap is only really used for making mobile scaling not an absolute nightmare. For the previous version of my site, I did all the scaling HTML, CSS, and JS myself, and it wound up just barely working on full-sized PC display, and virtually not at all on mobile displays. Bootstrap is also useful because of the pre-made design elements that it comes with, which are very similar to what my old site looked like as well, and through just a few dozen lines of CSS could look almost identical!</p>

<p>Hugo is a static site generator built in Google&rsquo;s Go language, which I use for managing my blog. One of the best things about Hugo is that it can convert Markdown to HTML-based blog posts, which simplifies the process massively, and also means that virtually anyone can write posts, regardless of prior programming knowledge! Hugo also uses pre-made themes, which can use Sass for styling, that are easily modifiable. A pretty big community has been created around creating these, which means that there is a huge variety of premade themes to choose from! The one I&rsquo;m using is a really great one called <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-journal">Journal</a>, who&rsquo;s use was inspired by <a href="http://blendogames.com/news/">Blendo&rsquo;s fantastic looking blog</a>. All-in-all, Hugo just makes managing content a lot easier, and is a cool piece of technology.</p>
